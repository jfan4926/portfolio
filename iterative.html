        <h2 id="context">Context and Purpose</h2>
        <p>This is a group work.
            We designed and produced our own version of an app developed
            by a startup with the concept and goals in mind, and summarized
            and improved our work through discussion and user experience..<br>
            <br>
            In practical development, it is very important to have a firm grasp of the core
            functionality and main idea of the application or software; this ensures that no time
            is wasted on unimportant things and makes it easier and faster for the customer to use.
            Likewise, hands-on experimentation by users can give us developers very important and
            valuable insights, and there are many blind spots or taken-for-granted ideas that we
            get ourselves into that come to light, thus allowing us to better find possibilities for improvement.

                            <li> Dropezy is a grocery delivery mobile application in Indonesia that aims to provide
                                <b>fast, convenient, affordable, and accessible</b> delivery services.
                            </li>
                            <li> Dropezy differs from other shopping platforms in that it offers users an easy and
                                convenient way to purchase <b>daily</b> needs online in smaller quantities, more
                                frequently, and <b>anytime</b>. </li>
                            <li> Besides lightning-fast deliveries to our customers, Dropezy cares about the safety,
                                health, and happiness of their <b>community</b>. </li>
                            <li> Dropezy embraced <b>transparency</b> and is <b>committed</b> to workplace safety and

                            people who live in urban and suburban areas, with regular online shopping habits and
                            relatively high consumption, who are more receptive to online shopping.

        <img src="images/Analysis.png" alt="User Testing Analysis" width="50%">
        <h5 class="h5-category">Summary</h5>

        <p style="margin-bottom:2%; margin-top:2%">We have three users showing quite different results. The first
            user performed okay with our prototyping. The second user, as an experienced grocery shopping app user,
            performed almost perfect as we expected.
            The third user encountered the most problems. All of them made valuable suggestions to our prototyping.
        </p>

        <p><b>Things we didn't expect:</b></p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:2%">
            <li>When users were assigned to purchase a specific item, all of them first chose to try out the search
                bar.
                Although some items were displayed on the main pages, they did not first check if their target items
                were on the main page.</li>
            <li>Our users clicked the add button twice to add two items to the cart. We expected users to first add
                the item to the cart,
                then adjust the number of items they want on the cart page.</li>
            <li>It may be because of the order we assigned the tasks, users tried to navigate from the recipe page
                directly to the follower page.</li>
            <li>When users navigated to the recipe page, all of them used the click button instead of swiping the
                screen to the recipe page.</li>
            <li>One user tried to find the salmon recipe in the shopping section for seafood, which showed that the
                idea of community is not that intuitive to users.</li>
            <li>Only one user realized that the follow button could be clicked.</li>
        </ul>


        <p><b>Things we can improve:</b></p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom:2%">
            <li>When the app is fully functional, we can solve the problems with the search bar and the "like/add to
                saved item" button on the home page.</li>
            <li>We can implement better navigation for the community section. Clicking the Community button should
                link back to the community's main page.</li>
            <li>We should allow the user to double-click to add items twice.</li>
            <li>We should show the number of items added to the cart on the home/category page and also allow users
                to modify the number of items added to the cart.</li>
            <li>We can think about a better "+follow" button so that more people can understand how to use it.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 id="justify">Part 4:Justify our design decisions </h3>
        <p>
            Our design strives to <b>achieve the company's original goals</b>, making Dropezy a <b>convenient and
                accessible</b> delivery tool and a <b>community</b> that cares.
            The cart page clearly layouts the taxes, shipping costs, and total prices, which guarantees
            <b>transparency</b>.
            We designed a favorite list, which allows users to <b>save time and effort</b> finding the item they want.
            A community feature allows users to share their shopping experience, find good recipes from influencers and
            discuss the hottest topics.
            Thus, Dropezy can better hear the voice of the users, select its products, and develop strategies to meet
            their <b>daily</b> needs.
        </p>

        <p>We implement interaction principles from three aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Interaction</b>
                <p>We kept users informed about their interactions with the interface by providing visual feedback. For
                    example, we included overlays to display confirmation messages when users add items to their carts
                    or check out their carts, so that users can know if their interaction with the interface is
                    successful.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Navigation</b>
                <p>We obtained user navigation accessibility in the interface.To maintain continuity, we added color to
                    the bottom navigation bar to indicate what page users are on, and used clear indications to help
                    users understand their destination and direction. Likewise, we included both swipes and clicks for
                    the community page, making it more mobile-friendly.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Hierarchy</b>
                <p>We kept the interface's overall clear and structured hierarchy. We applied design elements such as
                    colors, fonts, grids, and shadow effects to indicate the hierarchy of the interface.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="conclusion">✨Conslusion & Afterthoughts✨</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM</li>
            <p> A single design does not always bring users a satisfactory user experience; sometimes the design would
                even go to a totally wrong direction. </p>
            <li>GOAL</li>
            <P>The goal of this project is to improve iterative design and to conduct user testing in order to achieve
                better results.</P>
            <li>DISCUSSION</li>
            <p>As I insisted at the beginning and throughout my portfolio,
                a clean and effective design was my preferred goal.
                I had some disagreements with other teammates on the design of this project,
                such as the introduction of social features, but in the end I accepted the design
                for various reasons. I try to emphasize the importance of simplicity in my team work -
                so that users always know where they are, what they are doing, what they want to do,
                and what they can do - and this kind of goal-oriented design is very important for a
                fast-paced shopping software.
                If it were my own work, I would probably further simplify the social module and user
                settings interface, as well as reduce the number of steps required for users to search for items.
                Although this work is still a naive, I still enjoy the fun of teamwork and the new inspiration
                that comes from the clash of ideas.</p>
        </ul>
