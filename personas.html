        <h2 id="context">Context and Purpose</h2>
        <p style="padding: 1%">As a designer, we should look at a design from the user's point of view,
            rather than just imposing our own ideas on the user. When a design is not used by anyone,
            then it loses its value. Therefore, from the very beginning, I have tried to
            develop this user-based way of thinking and perspective. <br>In this project, I will take
            an actual user interface as an entry point, build a user profile through field observation,
            user research and a storyboard to simulate the user's experience, feelings and feedback during the process.
        </p>
        <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
        <p>I choose CVS self-checkout as the observed accessible interface.</p>
        <h3 id="interface">Interface Analysis</h3>
        <img src="images/interface.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" alt="Image" style="width: 70%">
        <p>In general, there are these four key interactive components in the interface:</p>
        <p><b>The scanning prompts,The confirmations,The payment selection,The get help button</b></p>
        <!-- <p>The confirmations</p>
        <p>The payment selection</p>
        <p>The get help button</p> -->
        <h3 id="user">User Interview</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>Questions</h4>
                <p>Are you a student? Please tell me a little about yourself.<br>
                    Have you previously used the self-checkout before? If so, how often do you use the
                    self-checkout?<br>
                    Is there something that's getting you stuck in the checkout process, or is there anything you need
                    that's hard to spot?<br>
                    What do you like/ dislike about the self-checkout?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                <p>The coupon-applying process is unclear and tedious.<br>
                    Too many options, buttons and words<br>
                    Inappropriate system voice prompts<br>
                    Confusing bagging instructions<br>
                    Pros: usually faster and contactless with more privacy</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h4><b>‚ú®Some Afterthoughts‚ú®</b></h4>
        <p>Revisiting the user interviews now, I can see many shortcomings - for example,
            the user group was limited and the questions asked were not specific enough.
            If one is to conduct in-depth research on users, it is important to obtain as much
            useful information as possible that is directly related to the possible problems.</p>
        <h3 id="persona">Personas Creation</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <img src="images/p1.png" class="img-responsive margin" alt="Image" style="width: 90%">
                <p>Jesse is a sophomore college student who just wants to drop by CVS after having dinner outside and on
                    her way back to the dorm.</p>
                <h4>Interface problems:</h4>
                <p>Jesse is having trouble with the overwhelming options since she does not know how to use the coupons
                    that is shown on the price tags. Also when she tries to put the scanned items into her backpack,
                    the self-checkout machine keeps alarming that she should place them into the bagging area,
                    which makes her really awkward.
                </p>
                <h4>Persona Representation:</h4>
                <p>
                    There is a large amount of young customers who just want to browse and do
                    some random shopping in a drug store, and they do not want to spend too much
                    time in the check out. They might not be frequent visitors, and they want to see
                    if there are any deals. Jesse fits into this type of users who is more receptive to using
                    self-checkout, but not familiar with the process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <img src="images/p2.png" class="img-responsive margin" alt="Image" style="width: 90%">
                <p>Ben is a young professional in his 30s. He is on his way home from gym after work, and wants to
                    quickly grab some snacks on his way home for a live football game.</p>
                <h4>Interface problems:</h4>
                <p>Ben scans the items (two energy bars) and places them aside, and the voice
                    loudly prompts him to place them in the bagging area, but he does not
                    need the bags. He is also in a hurry while the interface keeps prompting
                    selections and buttons that he does not need.
                </p>
                <h4>Persona Representation:</h4>
                <p>
                    There are times that users want to achieve their goals as soon as possible‚Äîfor example,
                    temporarily parking where they shouldn't have, or on their way to another thing. People in a
                    hurry with only a few things in their cart might consider self-checkout as a good option since it
                    eliminates the waiting line(sometimes) and small talk. Ben is this type of user‚Äîtired and in a
                    hurry‚Äîand will get frustrated when the interface and checkout process get too complicated.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM</li>
            <p> As I explained at the beginning, as a designer, we are prone to fall into some misconceptions from our
                point of view.</p>
            <li>GOAL</li>
            <P>The purpose of this project was to exercise my approach as a designer to see problems from the user's
                perspective. </P>
            <li>DISCUSSION</li>
            <p>As I get more feedback and revisit the results in light of what I have learned, I think there are a few
                points worth discussing.<br>
                1. As mentioned earlier, the results of my user survey were too broad and not well integrated with the
                actual problematic points of using this interface.<br>
                2. My user persona needs more polishing. Now it seems that the images of jesse and ben and the problems
                they encountered are somewhat repetitive.<br>
                3. As an introvert, this project gave me the courage to step out of my comfort zone of inertia and
                collect interviews to see things from a different perspective.
                I found this to be very challenging and rewarding.
                4. This project made me realize that there are a lot of people who encountered similar experiences with
                me - although this is a rather
                personal idea - every time I shop at CVS with the automatic checkout, the interface has a lot of
                options, and there is a constant audio prompt shouting on the side,
                so if you are in a hurry, it is really frustrating to use it. I hope CVS can improve!<br>
                5. It was fun to draw the storyboard!</p>
