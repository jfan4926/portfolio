        <h2 id="context">Context and Purpose</h2>
        <p style="padding: 1%">Looking back, as a Gen Z kid, I would use ü§ô this gesture for making a phone call,
            while the Gen Alpha kids are more familiar with the way smartphones works.
            The same goes for user design - times are changing and we as designers must change accordingly.
            We also have to admit that sometimes the exsiting interface is not very user-friendly in either usability,
            responsiveness or aesthetics aspects.
            From the user's perspective,
            the designer needs to create a product that will display and function properly (at least) most of the time -
            regardless of the size of the display and the type of device.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore, this project aims to design and build a responsive website based on low-fidelity and
            high-fidelity prototypes of an existing interface.

        <h2 id="process">Process</h2>
        <p>I picked <a href="https://www.sakispizza.com/">Sakis Pizza</a>
            because I think it is "simple yet poorly-designed":
            It is a simple website for a family-owned pizzeria, which basically shows its location, menu, introduction,
            and pictures.</p>

        <p>Revisiting the analysis of the original site again,
            I felt that there were other things I could discuss -
            such as images, color scheme, overall structure and ease of use for the user.</p>

        <p><b>Thoughts and comments:</b> <br>Since this is a pizzeria website, the biggest function is to quickly show
            their location, opening hours,
            contact information and menu. In order to present it as simple as possible,
            I created a one-page website and tried to put the important information in the most prominent position.</p>

                    <b>Menu problem: </b>
                    <p>For the container of the "menu" background, I use position: relative;
                        so that I can keep a relative position with the button.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Responsiveness: </b><br>
                    <p>I used display: block for each div because there are not many
                        flex elements required (besides the gallery and the later info images,
                        for which I use the row and column to adjust them better accordingly). <br>
                        I'm using rem font size for h1, h2, and h3 so that they're relative to the
                        root element and responsive on different device sizes while
                        maintaining proper text hierarchy.<br>
                        For side-by-side elements, such as the image and text in location & hours,
                        I used the float:left and right. I also adjusted the margin for a
                        better appearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Gallery display: </b><br>
                    <p>I adjusted the image sizes so that they will align better in the gallery.
                        For the gallery layout, I referred to
                        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HOWTO/howto_css_team.asp">w3schools</a>
                        for the alignment and
                        display.

                        them accordingly. See the redesigned website for more details.</p>

                                implies that it is clickable; when clicked, it links to the menu

                                I decided to discard the navigation bar.</p>

        <h3>Link:<a href="https://anxiousfish745.github.io/ResponsiveRedesign/redesign-sakispizza.html">Sakis Pizza</a>
        </h3>
        <p><b>Please note</b> that the actual phone layout is different from the low-fi and hi-fi prototypes. <br>
            I originally wanted to have the gallery with <b>one</b> image each row,
            but it seems that the gallery would be a little too long and the
            user would have to scroll for quite a long time.And the display works well for <b>two</b>
            images at the same time, so I decided to keep the layout design with
            two images instead of one with different device sizes.
        <p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">‚ú®Conslusion & Afterthoughts‚ú®</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PROBLEM</li>
            <p> Sometimes web pages only work in a specific display, which might be problematic.</p>
            <li>GOAL</li>
            <P>This project is to solve the problem of displaying the content properly in each display device.</P>
            <li>DISCUSSION</li>
            <p>In hindsight, because of my unfamiliarity with html and css, this early work of mine still looks slightly
                immature.
                One of the biggest purposes of this page - to be responsive on all display devices - was not done well
                enough.
                For example, the font may be a bit too small on handheld devices. Now I may choose to use more external
                resources,
                such as bootstrap, to make the whole page more neatly displayed. Also I may use inline pdf to display
                the
                menu,
                rather than jumping to an external page to open the pdf file. I'll also be more careful with some of the
                color schemes and fonts -
                although my intention was to keep the color scheme of the original site (orange and black), it's still
                not
                quite as good as it could be.</p>
